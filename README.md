Assignment 1 for ISM 6225

Self-Reflection:

Questions 1,2 & 3 were challenging but I was able to work through it with available resources. Questions 4,5,& 6 were particularly challenging as I am a very novice programmer at best. I struggled to get an output with question 6 but tried my best to work through the issues in my code to no avail. I also struggled with pushing my code via the git extension and had to manually upload my files to the repository--I will try my best to resolve this as soon as possible. The assignment took approximately 20 hours for me to complete. Though the assignment was defeating at times, I do feel more confident with my understanding of OOP.
